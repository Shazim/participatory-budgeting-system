# Warning: The database defined as "test" will be erased and
# re-generated from your development database when you run "rake".
# Do not set this db to the same as development or production.

# As with config/credentials.yml, you never want to store sensitive information
# like your database password in your source code. If your source code is
# ever seen by anyone, they now have access to your database.
#
# Instead, provide the password or a full connection URL as an environment
# variable when you boot the app. For example:
#
#   DATABASE_URL="postgres://myuser:mypass@localhost/somedatabase"
#
# If provided, a database URL will override the host, port, username, and password.
#
production:
  <<: *default
  database: assignment_1_production
  username: assignment_1
  password: <%= ENV["ASSIGNMENT_1_DATABASE_PASSWORD"] %>
